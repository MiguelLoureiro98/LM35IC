# LM35IC temperature sensors library
Arduino sensor driver for LM35 integrated circuit temperature sensors. The project is currently under way.

# Installation
The library has yet to be added to the Arduino Library Index. Once it is accepted, you will be able to install it using the Arduino Library Manager.

# Basic usage
See [this example](examples/basics.ino) for a basic guide on how to use this library.

# Examples
The library comes with several example sketches to help users understand how they can leverage their capabilities. The examples should be analysed in the following order:

1. [Get sensor reading](examples/basics.ino)
2. [Unit conversion](examples/unit_conversion.ino)
3. [Compute measurement accuracy](examples/compute_accuracy.ino)
4. [Compute measurement error](examples/compute_error.ino)
5. [Signal conditioning](examples/signal_conditioning.ino)
6. [Different ADC characteristics](examples/different_ADC.ino)
